## General Note

Try to run `test_opencv` as a separate debug environment in CLion. 
In the `test.cpp` file, change the run command for `image_path` according to the OS.
Currently, the path is set for windows.
For macOS users, they need to comment line 27 and uncomment line 29.
Vice-versa for Windows users.
