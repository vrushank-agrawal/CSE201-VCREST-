    ## Functionalities

    - What will your project do, precisely?

    ## Deadlines and deliverables

    - What intermediate deadlines do you have, and what subset of functionalities will you deliver in each deadline?

    Try to plan different stages for your project and have intermediate results you can show for each stage. This exercise will help you focusing your efforts and minimize the risks of failure.

    ## Software Architecture

    - How are you sub-dividing your project?Which modules are you implementing?

    - What is the interface of each module?
      You can define the interface with the public section of your class headers (note that not all classes need to be "exposed" from one module to the others).

    - What external dependencies do you have? Why?
