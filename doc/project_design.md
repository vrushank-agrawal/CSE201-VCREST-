    ## Functionalities

    The project aims to provide the user with a unique feature of automatically creating a video with custom images in a given audio file.
    -- A user will import an audio file and a set of custom images.
    -- A function in the program will analyze the audio file using FFT's and recognize the its bpm and troughs and peaks in the audio file.
    -- Another function will automatically organize these images (randomly or with user preference) and combine them with the audio to create a video.
    -- There will be additional simple animations and filters that can be added in the video for effects.
    -- The user will also be provided with the ability to rearrange these images and animations in the video in the GUI manually.
    
    END RESULT - You create a video of memories automatically with the tempo of a certain song for the right vibes!

    ## Deadlines and deliverables
    
    #WEEK 2
    -- functions for adding filters and animations in the image and video parts

    #WEEK 4
    -- Simple working GUI that previews the audio and the image files.
    -- Function to analyze the audio file returns valid values for image and video processing.
    -- A basic video can be made out of the imported images and audios.
    
    #WEEK 6
    -- Integration of the animations, filters, and audio processing functions to smoothly run with the GUI
    -- GUI will have manual editing ability for the user to manually edit images and animations for a more unique and personal video.

    Try to plan different stages for your project and have intermediate results you can show for each stage. This exercise will help you focusing your efforts and minimize the risks of failure.

    ## Software Architecture (TBD)

    - How are you sub-dividing your project?Which modules are you implementing?

    - What is the interface of each module?
      You can define the interface with the public section of your class headers (note that not all classes need to be "exposed" from one module to the others).

    - What external dependencies do you have? Why?
